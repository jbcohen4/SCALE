Run "pyinstaller gui.spec" from terminal.

If you add dependencies that are not python files, you will probably need to edit the gui.spec file to reflect that. ChatGPT or Bard can help.

You will also need to change the source code of anywhere where you use an external file (such as reading a .csv file, or using the Xyce.exe executable).
Again, ChatGPT and Bard are your friends.
